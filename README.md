# transformer_from_scratch
Comparison of my deterministic + causal ML framework for trustworthy + transparent xAI (reliable, robust, efficient, logic + symbolic at scale) on its superb efficiency over the sub-symbolic blind pattern matching "AI" called Deep Learning with it's State-of-the-Art architecture "transformer" (inefficient, redundant, highest compute+data consume)
